# Fake_news_detection

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a Fake News Detection project. The project aims to detect fake news articles using machine learning.

The main components of this repository include:
- `fake_news_detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the fake news detection model.
- `news.zip`: A compressed archive containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided in the `news.zip` file. It contains labeled news articles categorized as either real or fake. The dataset has been preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection
2. Extract the dataset:
   unzip news.zip
3. Open the fake_news_detection.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to explore the code and run the fake news detection model.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are used in this project:

NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn

## Usage
You can use the Jupyter Notebook (fake_news_detection.ipynb) as a guide to understand the fake news detection process, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. You can also modify the code to experiment with different models or techniques.
